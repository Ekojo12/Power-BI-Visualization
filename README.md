### Project Overview
---
An assignment on Data visualization using Power BI.
1. Creation of 15 visuals from the data shared.
2. Documentation of step by step analysis from the data.

### Data Sources
---
The data used for this assignment was shared by the facilator for Data Analysis class in SkilHarvest.
- It is an excel file comprsing of 30,800 columns and 10 rows.

### Tools Used
---
-Power BI
1. This was the tool used for transformation and loading of data.
2. It was also used to generate the visuals

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
The data was imported into Power BI where it was transformed and loaded. 
The necessary cleaning was made, Expansion of columns and Removing of Duplicates.
The data was then used for the visualizations;
1. Bar Charts
2. Cards
3. Pie Chart
4. Question and Answer
5. Matrices
6. Tables
7. Column Chart
8. Donut Chart

### Data Analysis
---
Total Return on Investment(ROI) was calculated, this was created as a calculated column using the formula;
```
Total ROI = [*#Revenue*] * [*#Units sold*]
```
Region Number was also calculated, using conditional column, where each region was assigned a number;
1. South West = 1
2. South East = 2
3. Noth East = 3
4. South South = 4
5. North Central = 5
6. North West = 6


### Results/Insights
From the analysis of the data and charts created, the following were the results;
1. Total Revenue amounted to 73bn
2. Total number of stores is 132
3. Total number of markets is 30,800
4. Sum of Units sold is 787k
5. The line of business with the highest revenue is Service Plan at 56bn, while the lowest is printer sales at 6bn.
6.  The region with the highest revenue is North East and the region with the highest ROI is North West
